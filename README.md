# Workout Logger

    `Web-based mobile application for logging daily workouts.`

>Using the Blackberry HTML5 WebWorks 2.2 platform to develop an app that gives
me an interface to log my daily workouts. I will be able to use the logged
workouts to qualify my progress on a weekly basis. The app is mainly built using
JavaScript by adding a Processing.js script to the index.html file. The JavaScript
will handle all of the user interface functionality. I am also using Python to
access access the MySQL server that stores the workout log data.
